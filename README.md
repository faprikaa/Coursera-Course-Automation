## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Login**: Uses cookies to authenticate with Coursera
- **Question Extraction**: Automatically scrapes quiz questions and multiple-choice options
- **AI-Powered Answers**: Leverages OpenAI/Azure OpenAI to select the most appropriate answers
- **Auto-Submission**: Automatically fills in name, checks agreement, and submits the quiz
- **Grade Display**: Shows the quiz grade after submission
- **Retry Logic**: Implements retry mechanism for API calls to handle failures gracefully

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation
- **OpenAI API**: For AI-powered answer selection
- **python-dotenv**: For environment variable management

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)
- OpenAI API key or Azure OpenAI credentials

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Coursera-Course-Automation.git
   cd Coursera-Course-Automation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install selenium openai python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Download ChromeDriver**
   - Download ChromeDriver from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
   - Ensure it matches your Chrome browser version
   - Add ChromeDriver to your system PATH

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root:
   ```env
   API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   API_MODEL=gpt-4
   API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
   ```

   For Azure OpenAI:
   ```env
   API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
   API_MODEL=gpt-4
   API_BASE_URL=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
   ```

2. **Get Coursera Cookies**:
   - Open your browser and log in to Coursera
   - Use a browser extension (like EditThisCookie or Cookie Editor) to export cookies
   - Copy the cookies JSON and replace the `COOKIES` variable in `quiz_solving.py`

3. **Set Quiz URL**:
   - Update the `QUIZ_URL` variable in `quiz_solving.py` with your target quiz URL

4. **Update Your Name**:
   - In `QuizSolver.py`, update the name in `name_input.send_keys("Muammar Mufid")` with your legal name

## üìñ Usage

1. **Run the automation script**:
   ```bash
   python quiz_solving.py
   ```

2. **The script will**:
   - Open Chrome browser
   - Navigate to Coursera and authenticate using cookies
   - Go to the specified quiz URL
   - Click the start button
   - Extract all questions and answers
   - Send questions to AI for answer selection
   - Automatically select the AI-recommended answers
   - Fill in your name and submit the quiz
   - Display your grade

3. **Wait for completion** - The browser will remain open until you press Enter

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
Coursera-Course-Automation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QuizSolver.py          # Main quiz solver class with automation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quiz_solving.py        # Entry point script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Project documentation

```

## üîß How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Uses exported cookies to maintain logged-in session
2. **Navigation**: Selenium WebDriver navigates to the quiz and clicks start
3. **Extraction**: Scrapes question text and all answer options using CSS selectors
4. **AI Processing**: 
   - Formats questions into a prompt
   - Sends to OpenAI API
   - Receives structured JSON response with selected options
5. **Answer Selection**: Automatically clicks the checkboxes for selected answers
6. **Submission**: Checks agreement, fills name, and submits the quiz
7. **Result**: Displays the grade received

## üéØ Key Components

### QuizSolver Class

- `solve_quiz(quiz_url)`: Main method that orchestrates the entire quiz-solving process
- `ask_ai(prompt, max_retries=3)`: Sends questions to AI and handles retries

### Helper Functions

- `create_prompt(qas)`: Formats questions and answers into an AI-friendly prompt
- `print_qas(qas)`: Utility function to print questions and answers

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**ChromeDriver Issues**:
- Ensure ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser
- Add ChromeDriver to system PATH

**Cookie Authentication Fails**:
- Export fresh cookies from a logged-in Coursera session
- Ensure all required cookies are included

**AI API Errors**:
- Verify API key is correct in `.env`
- Check API rate limits and quotas
- Ensure the model name is correct

**Element Not Found**:
- Coursera may have updated their UI
- Update CSS selectors in `QuizSolver.py`

## üìù Customization

You can customize the AI behavior by modifying:
- **System prompt** in `ask_ai()` method
- **Temperature** setting (currently 0 for deterministic answers)
- **Model** in `.env` file (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4)
- **Wait times** in WebDriverWait calls
